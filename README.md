# Hi, I’m Martin Pasche (@martinpasche)

Quantitative researcher and engineer passionate about bridging mathematics, programming, and finance. Experienced in developing stochastic models, implementing Monte Carlo simulations, and applying deep learning techniques to pricing and risk management problems.

## About Me
I’m a **Mathematical & Computational Engineer** pursuing a double degree at CentraleSupélec and PUC Chile, specializing in Quantitative Finance and Financial Engineering. At CentraleSupélec, I'm working on my *diplôme d'ingénieur* with a specialization in **Quantitative Finance**. My academic and professional journey revolves around combining **mathematical modeling**, **data science**, and **finance** to tackle complex challenges.

## Areas of Interest
- **Quantitative Finance**: Building and optimizing models for financial markets.
- **Deep Learning in Finance**: Applying AI to develop data-driven trading and pricing strategies.
- **Research**: Exploring stochastic models, time series forecasting, and numerical methods.
- **Coding**: Developing solutions in Python using Numpy, Statsmodels, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.

## Currently Exploring
- Advanced time series forecasting techniques, including **SARIMAX**, **ARDL**, **CVAR**, and **LSTM**.
- Optimization of computational performance in complex financial simulations.
- Stochastic volatility and jump diffusion processes.
- Hull White stochastic model for pricing in a Asset Liabilities Context, for simulating Euribor3M.
